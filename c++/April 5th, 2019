## Some tips when programming in c++

Today I spent about 3.5 hours in solving leetcode problems. I finished 4 problems and 3 of them are in the easy class and one belongs to hard. It's not writing the code that costs so much time, but to figure out what the problem is telling me to do and, of course, debugging. I only covered cpp primer once and there are a lot of details about functions and containers I can't remember clearly. So I spent a lot of time in reading the way of usage. The next time I read the book, I guess I'll have to finish all the assignments.
