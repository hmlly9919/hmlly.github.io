# Welcome to my page

Hello guys, it's the first time that I create a README about my own page.
It's really nice to see that there are so many talented developers out there.
This is a very good place to learn more about programming and the world.
Since I'm just a student at my second year at university, frequent update my not be available.
I'm really looking forward to meeting you. xD
